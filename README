Project created in xCode on MacOS 10.14

paths to files are absolute and might need to be changed if you are running this on a different computer.

Line endings may vary from file to file (especially the scene files)

For best experience I would recomend running this code OSX


Intruction to run

1. make sure you change the file Paths to your own in main.cpp
2. (optional is you use OSX) add the apropriate #includes for your operating system
3. Run and Enjoy!
